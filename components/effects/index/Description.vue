      The <span style="font-weight: bold;"> Subjective Effect Index </span> is a set of articles designed to serve as a comprehensive catalogue and reference for the range of subjective effects that may occur under the influence of psychoactive substances and other psychonautic techniques.

          that avoids the use of flowery metaphors or analogy; instead, they strive to use simple and accessible language. This is done with the hope that they will eventually serve as a universal terminology set that enables people to better communicate and share experiences that are, by nature, difficult to convey.

          The Index is separated into {{ effectCount }} effects, which are organised into categories based on the senses they affect and their behavior. Many of these are further broken down into leveling systems, subcomponents, and style variations that may occur across different substances. Detailed image, video, and audio <nuxt-link to="/replications">
