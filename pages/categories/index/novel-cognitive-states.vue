    <p>
      <b>Novel cognitive states</b> are defined as any cognitive effect that does not merely amplify or suppress familiar states of mind; rather, it induces an experience that is qualitatively different from that of ordinary consciousness.

      Although many <nuxt-link to="/categories/transpersonal-effects">
        transpersonal
      </nuxt-link> and <nuxt-link to="/categories/psychological-states">
        psychological effects
      </nuxt-link> also technically fit into this definition, they are excluded from this category as they have their own defining qualities that standard novel states do not.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      This page lists the various novel cognitive states that can occur under the influence of certain psychoactive compounds.
