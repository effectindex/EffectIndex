      <b>Transpersonal effects</b> are defined as any subjective effect that feels as if it alters a person's cognition in a manner that relates to their place in the universe, the inner workings of reality or consciousness, and/or the context of their existence. The highest manifestations of these effects fall under what are commonly known as "peak", "transcendent" or "transformative" experiences.
    </p>

    <p>
      These effects are typically associated with high dose <nuxt-link to="/effects/psychedelic-intensity-scale">
        psychedelic
      </nuxt-link> or <nuxt-link to="/effects/dissociative-intensity-scale">
        dissociative
      </nuxt-link> experiences. They can occur regardless of the person's spiritual or religious beliefs and often have a distinct and lasting impact on the user's perspective of the world around them. During the experience of a substance-induced transpersonal state, the information conveyed is often felt to be a real and objective truth. However, the person will often come to disagree with these supposed "epiphanies" once the effects of the substance have worn off.
    </p>

    <p>
      It should be noted that these mind-states are the least reproducible of all effects within the <nuxt-link to="/effects/">
        Subjective Effect Index.
      </nuxt-link> Simply taking more of a given substance does not necessarily increase the chances of having these states occur. Instead, they seem to rely more on contextual factors, such as the person's set and setting.
