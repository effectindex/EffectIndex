    <p>
      <b>Geometric patterns</b> are defined as any subjective effect that introduces complex arrays of shapes, colours, symbols, patterns, geometry, form constants, and fractals to one's field of vision.
    </p>

    <p>
      Within the context of psychedelic substances, effects within this category are often speculated to not simply be another form of hallucination, but instead a result of neurological signals and processes from various regions of the brain bleeding into the visual cortex and being reinterpreted as complex geometric forms.
