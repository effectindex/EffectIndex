      <h1> Subjective Effects of Dissociatives </h1>
      <div class="categoryDescription">
        <p>
          <b> Dissociatives </b> are a class of hallucinogen which distort perceptions of sight and sound to produce feelings of disconnection, detachment, and dissociation from the environment and self. These effects occur due to the way in which these compounds function as NMDA receptor antagonists. This means they bind to receptors in the brain but do not activate them, thus blocking other neurotransmitters from doing so. The result is a dose-dependent decrease in the passing of electrical signals across the brain and an overall disconnection of neurons, which leads to states of disconnection between conscious parts of the brain and its sensory organs.

          This article breaks down the subjective effects of the dissociative experience into simple and easy
          to understand descriptions with accompanying image replications. This is done without resorting to metaphor,
          analogy, or personal trip reports.
        </p>

        <p>
          These descriptions are not specific to any particular substance but are applicable to the effects 
          which commonly occur in various forms under the influence of almost any dissociative compound. This
          includes, but is not limited to, both classical and research chemical dissociatives, such as:

            Diphenidine, Ephenidine, Methoxphenidine </i>

        <b> Disconnective effects </b> are any subjective effect which feels as if it detaches or disconnects one from the external environment, 
        their senses, and their consciousness. <br> <br>

        These effects are typically associated with dissociative hallucinogens and likely
        occur due to the way in which these compounds function as NMDA receptor antagonists.
        This means they bind to the receptor, but do not activate it and block other
        neurotransmitters from doing so. The result is a dose-dependent decrease in the 
        passing of electrical signals across the brain and an overall disconnection of neurons,
        which leads to states of disconnection between conscious parts of the brain and its
        sensory organs.
