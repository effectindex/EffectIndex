      <h1> Miscellaneous Effects of Psychedelics </h1>
      <div class="categoryDescription">
        <p> This article breaks down the subjective miscellaneous effects of the psychedelic experience into simple and easy to understand descriptions with accompanying image replications. This is done without resorting to metaphor, analogy, or personal trip reports. </p>
        <p> These descriptions are not specific to any particular substance but are applicable to the effects which commonly occur in various forms under the influence of almost any psychedelic compound. This includes, but is not limited to, both classical and research chemical psychedelics, such as: </p>
        <p style="font-style: italic;">
          LSD, Psilocybin mushrooms, DMT, Ayahuasca, Mescaline, 5-MeO-MiPT, 2C-B, LSA, AL-LAD, ALD-52, 1P-LSD, 2C-B-Fly, 2C-C, 2C-D, 2C-E, 2C-P, 4-AcO-DMT, 4-HO-MET, 4-HO-MiPT, 5-MeO-DMT, DPT, and DOC.
        </p>
        <p> The article begins with a description of the simpler effects and works its way up towards more complex experiences as it progresses. Individual effects are also summarized with a link to their full article. </p>

        Although some hallucinatory effects may affect multiple senses at one time they are usually

        For example, while experiences with autonomous entities may sometimes have a tactile component to them, more often
        than not they are primarily a visual experience and are therefore classified as such.

        An <b> uncomfortable physical effect </b> is any

        of a substance's interaction with the body. However, in certain contexts, they can also 
        indicate the need for attention or even medical treatment if they become dangerously severe.
