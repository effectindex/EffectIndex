      <h1> Cognitive Effects of Psychedelics </h1>
      <div class="categoryDescription">
        <p> This article breaks down the subjective cognitive effects of the psychedelic experience into simple and easy to understand descriptions with accompanying image replications. This is done without resorting to metaphor, analogy, or personal trip reports. </p>
        <p> These descriptions are not specific to any particular substance but are applicable to the effects which commonly occur in various forms under the influence of almost any psychedelic compound. This includes, but is not limited to, both classical and research chemical psychedelics, such as: </p>
        <p style="font-style: italic;">
          LSD, Psilocybin mushrooms, DMT, Ayahuasca, Mescaline, 5-MeO-MiPT, 2C-B, LSA, AL-LAD, ALD-52, 1P-LSD, 2C-B-Fly, 2C-C, 2C-D, 2C-E, 2C-P, 4-AcO-DMT, 4-HO-MET, 4-HO-MiPT, 5-MeO-DMT, DPT, and DOC.
        </p>
        <p> The article begins with a description of the simpler effects and works its way up towards more complex experiences as it progresses. Individual effects are also summarized with a link to their full article. </p>

        A <b> novel cognitive state </b> is any cognitive effect which does not
        merely amplify or suppress familiar states of mind, but rather induces an experience that is qualitatively
        different from that of ordinary consciousness. <br> <br>
        Although many transpersonal and psychological effects also technically fit into this definition, they are
        excluded from this category of effects as they have their own defining qualities which standard novel states do not.

        the inner workings of reality or consciousness, and the context of their existence. The fullest manifestation of 
        these effects fall under what are sometimes called "peak", "transcendent" or "transformative" experiences.
