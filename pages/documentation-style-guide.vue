    <h3> Rules of Thumb </h3>

    <ul>
      <li> Use simplistic and easily understandable language over complex and obscure language wherever possible. This is to ensure that the SEI is as accessible to the general public as possible.  </li>
      <li>
        Do not make absolute or black/white assertions. For example "XYZ can creating the feeling that"
        over "XYZ will create the feeling that"
      </li>
      <li>
        Do not talk about the conclusions reached during these states as if they are inherently true, 
        instead make it clear that you are simply describing the experience of them.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3> Write about facts, note speculation: </h3>

    <ul>
      <li> Find a balance between (a) acknowledging when content is subjective or speculative, and (b) using a direct and confident writing style. </li>
      <li> Do not make absolute or black/white assertions. For example "XYZ can creating the feeling that" over "XYZ will create the feeling that" </li>
      <li> Do not talk about the conclusions reached during these states as if they are inherently true, instead make it clear that you are simply describing the experience of them. </li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3> Levels of intensity intro </h3>
    
    <p> "This effect is capable of manifesting itself across the x different levels of intensity described below:" </p>

    <h3> Tiers </h3>

    <ul>
      <li> At the lowest level, … </li>
      <li> At this level, … </li>
      <li> At the highest level, … </li>
    </ul>

    <h3> Referring to the experiencer </h3>
    
    <ul>
      <li> “A person” is preferred </li>
      <ul style="margin-bottom: 0;">
        <li> "At this level a person experiences morphing" </li>
      </ul>
      <li> “One’s” is secondary and provides variety </li>
      <li> “At this level one’s vision is completely encompassed by geometry” </li>
    </ul>

    <h3> Outro paragraph sentence: </h3>

    <p>
      "Effect is most commonly induced under the influence of low/moderate/heavy dosages of hallucinogenic compounds, 
      such as type list. However, it can also occur under the influence of type list, particularly during phase [or as a result of x]"
    </p>

    <h3> Word preferences: </h3>
    <ul>
      <li> To describe a given environment in its entirety: <i> Scene </i> </li>
      <li> To describe the surface of a given object (like the surface of a wall in a video game): <i> Texture </i> </li>
      <li> To describe a given object: <i> Object </i> </li>
      <li> To describe the experience of an effect of an illusion: <i> Perception </i> </li>
      <li> To describe increasing intensity across multiple tiers: <i> Progressive </i> </li>
      <li> To describe common sober experiences (to contrast with intoxicated effects): <i> Everyday (life) </i> </li>
      <li> To describe an illusion the subject recognizes to be false: <i> Hallucination / hallucinatory </i> </li>
      <li> To describe an illusion the subject cannot recognize as such: <i> Delusion </i> </li>
      <li> To describe the lower bound of an effect range: <i> Subtle </i> </li>
      <li> To describe the upper bound of an effect range: <i> Extreme </i> </li>
    </ul>

    <h3> Grammatical/syntax preferences: </h3>
    <ul>
      <li> To refer to all possible trips: use "a trip" or "a [substance] trip" is preferred when referring to a trip. This makes the language general and inclusive, so it is clear that a specific trip or kind of trip is not being denoted. Example: "The first stage of a DMT trip is the onset" </li>
      <li> To refer to specific trips: use "the trip": use "the trip" or "the [substance] trip" when referring to a specific trip in narrative, or when a kind of experience given specific parameters is being discussed. Example: "After describing the LSD trip Hofmann had experienced, the lecture hall giggled." </li>
      <li> Use of and/or: Do not use "and/or", it can always be replaced with more specific language that is more readable. </li>
    </ul>
