      This a semi-private community and is not primarily for general conversation; instead, it aims to be a place of discussion and co-operation for progressing the field of formalised subjective effect documentation. For this reason, we tend to only invite people who genuinely want to contribute to the project. This can include anyone from proofreaders, trip reporters, web developers, programmers, replicators, artists, and more.
